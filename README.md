# VBA-challenge
Repository for my VBA module homework for the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp.

# Instructions for Grader
For this assignment, I used two different VBA modules. Both will need to be imported.
First, I would import the "Sub tickercode()" script as module 1, then the "CallColors" module, as it will be needed for module 1 to function.

I added both .txt and .bas files for the my two code modules, either one should hopefully work. I also included screenshots of the spreadsheet after I ran my code. I tried to include the final spreadsheet that my code was tested on, but it was too large for uploading onto GitHub.

Collaboration was made with classmates to assist with the final production of this code, as well as internet resources to locate VBA functions not covered in class.
